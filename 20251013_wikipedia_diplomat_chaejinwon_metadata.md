Below is my attempt at performing **metadata extraction** for **Chae Jin-won (채진원)** as a living person, using publicly available sources, internal in-session corpus, and reference to latent knowledge. Because the person is (to my knowledge) not extremely widely covered, many fields will remain “unknown” or “inferred with low confidence.” Still, I produce a full multilayered output: summary, tables, relational triples, JSON-LD, Chicago notes, and an audit log.

I caution that I cannot verify private or non-public details; all content is based on publicly accessible sources.

## Part A. Human-Readable Summary

**Snapshot (gist):**
Chae Jin-won (채진원) is a South Korean (Republic of Korea) career diplomat who, as of 2025, serves as the Consul General of the Republic of Korea in São Paulo (상파울루), Brazil. He has held prior senior posts including Ambassador to Rwanda, and was appointed as an “international relations envoy” for Gyeongsangbuk Province. His expertise appears to lie in international economic cooperation, development diplomacy, and regional/consular affairs.

**Identity and Identifiers:**

* Name (English / Korean): Chae Jin-won (채진원)
* Romanization variants: Chae Jin-won (official), Ch’oe Chin-wŏn (McCune–Reischauer) etc. (per Wikipedia) ([위키백과][1])
* Nationality: South Korea (Republic of Korea)
* Occupation: Diplomat / Consul General / Foreign Service Officer

**Life & Career Timeline:**

* (Unknown birth date) — born in Jeju, South Korea (제주특별자치도) ([위키백과][1])
* Graduated from Seoul National University, majoring in International Economics (국제경제학) ([위키백과][1])
* Passed the 36th Administrative Exam (행정고시) — entry path to civil/public service ([위키백과][1])
* Served in the Ministry of Commerce/Industry/Trade (통상산업부) (dates unknown) ([위키백과][1])
* Held role of Director (or similar) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in economic cooperation division (경제협력과장) (dates unknown) ([위키백과][1])
* Served as Counselor / Chargé d’affaires / Minister-Counsellor, possibly in Australia (公使級) (dates uncertain) ([위키백과][1])
* Appointed Ambassador (extraordinary and plenipotentiary) to Rwanda, with credential presentation in October 2020 ([위키백과][1])
* Term as Rwanda Ambassador ended in June 2023 ([위키백과][1])
* August 2023: appointed as Gyeongsangbuk Province “International Relations Envoy” (경상북도 국제관계대사) ([경북도청][2])
* July 10, 2024: formally assumed the post of Consul General of South Korea in São Paulo (주상파울루 대한민국 총영사) ([위키백과][1])

**Affiliations, Roles & Authority:**

* Employed by: Republic of Korea Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)
* Current Role: Consul General in São Paulo, Brazil
* Previous diplomatic roles: Ambassador to Rwanda, Foreign Service roles in trade/economic diplomacy
* Regional role: Adviser/Envoy to Gyeongsangbuk Province (local government diplomacy)

**Outputs, Signature Projects & Initiatives:**

* Spearheaded or supported cultural diplomacy events in Brazil (e.g. “Korea Culture Day”, “K-fashion / hanbok events”) per consulate materials ([해외안전여행][3])
* Participated in content industry cooperation in Brazil (KOCCA business centers) — his presence noted in opening ceremony of a Brazil content industry event in early 2025 ([Chosunbiz][4])
* In consulate’s 2025 New Year address, referenced improvements in security of Korean community, growth of diaspora businesses, local public safety in Bom Retiro district, etc. ([해외안전여행][3])

**Media & Platforms:**

* The São Paulo consulate website publishes his messages (e.g. New Year message) ([해외안전여행][3])
* Local Korean-Brazilian news outlets report his activities (e.g. Dongpo News) ([재외동포신문][5])
* Social media (e.g. Instagram) shows diplomatic visits, courtesy calls (e.g. visit to other consular officials) ([Instagram][6])

**Network, Collaboration & Influence:**

* He liaises with local Brazilian governmental bodies (city, police, municipal) for diaspora safety programs (mentioned in consulate’s homepage) ([해외안전여행][7])
* Engages with cultural/content industry actors in Brazil (via KOCCA event) ([Chosunbiz][4])
* As a province-level envoy, he likely works across central–local government boundaries in Korea (Gyeongsangbuk) ([경북도청][2])

**Incidents, Controversies & Crises:**

* No prominent controversies or negative incidents are publicly documented in the sources I found.
* His appointment and roles appear standard for a career diplomat.

**Comparators & Benchmarks:**

* Comparable figures: Other South Korean diplomats serving as Consuls General in large consular posts (e.g. New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai)
* Benchmark: Ambassadors and Consuls General of similar rank, especially those with prior ambassadorial experience
* Within regional diplomacy: diplomats combining economic cooperation and consular outreach

**Reception, Reputation & Metrics:**

* He appears to enjoy positive coverage in diaspora media (emphasis on “community stability”, “service to diaspora”) ([재외동포신문][5])
* He received a formal appointment ceremony covered by Korean diaspora media (Hanin Today) when assuming the São Paulo post ([hanintoday.com.br][8])

**Law, Standards & Governance Mapping:**

* His roles fall squarely under the legal framework of South Korean diplomatic service (Foreign Service Act, MFA organizational rules)
* As consular head, responsibilities include consular protection, issuance of passports/visas, supporting diaspora rights — these are standard per Vienna Convention on Consular Relations

**Data Quality, Ambiguities & Limits:**

* Many dates (birth, early career) are missing or “unknown”
* Lack of primary documents (e.g. official MFA biographies) limits verification
* Some evidence is from diaspora press, whose fact-checking may vary

**Topologically Similar–Trajectory Juxtaposition (preliminary):**
Because of his trajectory (economic diplomacy → ambassador to mid-tier nation → major consular post in large diaspora hub), some similar public service diplomats could include:

* Korean diplomats who have shifted between ambassadorial posts and consular leadership (e.g. Ambassador → Consul General)
* Diplomats specializing in diaspora affairs, trade/economic diplomacy, and regional/local linkages
  At present I do not have sufficient seed candidates to compute a robust similarity score, so this remains an area for future elaboration.

## Part F. Audit Log

**Extraction rules & steps:**

* Recognized “채진원” as target; normalized to “Chae Jin-won (채진원)” using bilingual proper-noun rule.
* Searched publicly: found Korean Wikipedia, ministry / consulate websites, diaspora news, consular address site.
* Extracted roles, dates, and institutions from distinct sources; cross-checked where overlapping.
* Where direct date was absent, marked as “unknown” or “probable / plausible” rather than assuming.

**Manual corrections / disambiguation:**

* Because no standard external identifier (e.g. Wikidata Q) was readily found, I left `sameAs` empty.
* I did not include private info (birth date, personal contact) because not publicly verifiable.
* I corrected for possible mistranslations (e.g. “공사” interpreted as diplomatic rank).

**Remaining queries / missing items:**

* Exact birth date (year, month, day) is not found.
* Details of earlier diplomatic posts (dates, postings, rank) before ambassador level.
* Any authored works (articles, speeches) with formal publication metadata.
* Confirmation of external IDs (Wikidata Q, VIAF, ORCID).
* Seed candidates for similar-trajectory comparison not yet identified.

**Limits, bias, and data quality:**

* Heavy reliance on diaspora press and Korean-language sources, which may emphasize flattering angles.
* Lack of independent major media or academic coverage limits depth.
* Gaps in early career make causal inference about skills or transitions tentative.
* No controversy or criticism found — but that may reflect absence of reporting rather than absence of issues.

**Similarity juxtaposition log:**

* SIMILARITY_ARCHETYPE mode set to yes but no candidate seeds provided; hence no computed similarity comparisons.
* In future, one might compare Chae Jin-won with other Korean diplomats who've moved between ambassador and consular roles, or who engaged in diaspora/regional diplomacy.

If you like, I can now **extend the analysis** by filling in missing gaps (e.g. searching further for his early assignments, linking to comparable diplomats) and produce **visual network diagrams** or **topological similarity maps**. Would you like me to continue in that direction?
