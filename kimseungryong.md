\==================== OUTPUT START ====================

Part A. Reader-friendly summary

* Snapshot:

  * Kim Seung-ryong is the Deputy Commissioner (Fire Superintendent General) of the National Fire Agency (NFA), Republic of Korea, appointed on 16 September 2025 and concurrently designated Acting Commissioner due to a leadership vacancy. His career blends frontline command, national policy, technology modernization, and training doctrine, with a signature emphasis on logistics-centric operations under climate stress.
* Identity and identifiers:

  * Name: Kim Seung-ryong (romanized)
  * Birth: 21 March 1967; birthplace: Iksan, Jeonbuk (Republic of Korea)
  * Education: Wonkwang High School; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (German Studies, BA); University of Seoul Graduate School of Urban Science (MS, Disaster Prevention Engineering); Hanyang University Graduate School (Public Administration, doctoral coursework completed).
* Life and career timeline:

  * Commissioned as Fire Officer via Cadet Class 9 (February 1997); frontline postings at Yongsan, Songpa, Gangnam, Jungnang (Seoul); mixed field/administrative tours at Central 119 Rescue Unit and the deputy’s office of the predecessor agency; senior posts from 2019 onward culminating in Jeonbuk Fire Chief (2021), MOIS Fire Policy Officer (2022), NFA Spokesperson (2022), DG of Equipment & Technology (2023), President of Central Fire Service Academy (2024), Chief of Gangwon Fire HQ (2025), and NFA Deputy Commissioner (2025).
* Ranks, posts, and personnel actions:

  * Interpreted promotion to senior officer grade upon assuming Fire Response Investigation Division directorship (2019-09) \[inference]; promotion to Commissioner grade with Jeonbuk Fire Chief appointment (2021-02-11); promotion to Fire Superintendent General with NFA Deputy Commissioner appointment (2025-09-16).
* Affiliations, roles, and ICS chain:

  * National Fire Agency (NFA) deputy head; when the commissioner is suspended or absent, the deputy serves as acting commissioner. National remit spans \~60,000 firefighters and \~240 stations. ICS roles exercised across career include IncidentCommander (provincial-level), Logistics (sustained convoy operations), and PIO (as former NFA Spokesperson).
* Major responses and incidents:

  * Gangneung Drought Emergency (late Aug–mid Sep 2025): led a multi-week potable-water shuttle—\~893 engines/tankers, 1,707 personnel, \~30,000 tons delivered to treatment works and local nodes; integrated volunteer brigades for bottled-water distribution; framing quote: “Every drop we deliver is lifesaving water.” Outcomes: continuity of basic services, public confidence, blueprint for wide-area mutual aid and staggered dispatch.
* Outputs, guidelines, and presentations:

  * As Academy President (2024), emphasized hands-on simulation, standardization across regional fire schools, and doctrine alignment with equipment standards; as DG Equipment & Technology (2023), advanced modernization and AI-assisted forecasting pilots.
* Media and platforms:

  * Multiple national and regional media documented his 2025 appointments and the Gangneung drought response; NFA press materials serve as primary confirmation for appointment and rank.
* Concepts and keywords:

  * Promotion event; incident command; interagency operations; policy reform; climate adaptation; data-driven prevention; training doctrine.
* Network and collaboration:

  * Cooperation with volunteer brigades; partnership MOU with a national climate-adaptation institute; coordination with municipal and provincial governments under sustained operations.
* Issues, controversies, and follow-up improvements:

  * His acting role began amid suspensions of the commissioner and deputy commissioner linked to a special prosecutor’s probe; sector commentary highlighted the need for tenure safeguards and faster resolution of central leadership gaps.
* Comparative peer benchmark:

  * Within Korea’s fire service topology, Lee Young-pal (national-level field leadership across wildfires, typhoon floods, mine collapse) offers a complementary axis—heavy incident massing and doctrine—while Kim accents equipment–training–data–climate integrations that rib and stabilize the system. (Synthesis from session corpus and in-session analysis.)
* Recognition, reputation, decorations:

  * Public and media framing as a “problem-solver at the scene” during Gangneung, with emphasis on responsibility and mission ethos; specific decorations not enumerated in corpus (Unknown).
* Law, standards, and guidance mapping:

  * Internalization of ICS principles to Korean terrain/logistics; push toward PS-LTE/UHF hybrid doctrine (policy aspiration inferred); calls for equipment-life-cycle standardization and aviation safety budget firewalls (policy needs, inference).
* Data quality and ambiguity:

  * 2019 promotion level is inferred from role/title context; timeline dates otherwise anchored to explicit appointment lines and press materials in the corpus.
* Similarity archetype juxtaposition:

  * Peer set sketched as: Lee Young-pal; Heo Seok-gon; Choi Kwang-mo (public safety education and interagency training leadership); plus two placeholders pending broader primary-source sweep (Unknown). Weights applied: {state:0.35, event:0.30, network:0.15, concept:0.10, geo:0.07, media:0.03}. (See Part B8 and Part F.)

Part F. Audit log

* Auto-extraction rules summary:

  * Parsed corpus for personnel verbs (appointed, promoted, seconded) and incident numerics; normalized dates to ISO; mapped posts to organization entities; classified the 2025 Gangneung operation as ems (drought water supply).
* Manual adjustments:

  * Interpreted 2019 role as an implied rank elevation (probable); approximated start/end bounds for Gangneung operation per “two-plus weeks” language; assigned ICS roles (IncidentCommander/Logistics) based on convoy design and provincial command.
* Outstanding queries:

  * Confirm precise coordinates and exact daily tonnage cadence; verify any decorations/awards; retrieve formal PS-LTE/UHF hybrid doctrine references; identify YouTube or official video artifacts of briefings. (Unknown in corpus.)
* Limitations and bias notes:

  * Session corpus is a synthesized dossier with embedded media references; primary confirmation for the 2025-09-16 appointment is strong via the policy briefing URL; some intermediate rank transitions are inferred from post titles.
* Similarity juxtaposition log:

  * Applied weights {state:0.35, event:0.30, network:0.15, concept:0.10, geo:0.07, media:0.03}; nearest peer identified as Lee Young-pal (incident-driven arc); secondary peer Heo Seok-gon (commissioner-level governance); tertiary edge case Choi Kwang-mo (education/public-safety nexus); two placeholders retained pending broader primary-source expansion.
