## Political Realignment Narrative
- Initially **declined** the PM offer due to anticipated **tensions** with a **172-seat opposition (Democratic Party)**.
- **Cross-ideological career** fed a **“defection/betrayal”** narrative among some in the opposition:
  - **Last PM under Roh Moo-hyun (노무현)**.
  - **First Ambassador to the U.S. under Lee Myung-bak (이명박)**.
- **Park Ji-won (박지원)** recounts that **Kim Dae-jung (김대중)** personally suggested **Han (한덕수)** prepare for a **Seoul (서울)** mayoral run, yet Han left for the **Ambassador to the U.S.** role without notice (as recalled).

## Image Shift: From “Kind Deoksu” to “Bad Han Duck-soo”
- Past nicknames: “**Kind Deoksu**,” “**Right-fit PM**,” “**Straight-life man**.”
- As **Deputy PM (two years before becoming PM)** he vowed to be a **“colorless”** economic chief for policy consistency.
- Under **Yoon (윤석열)**, he **transformed**:
  - In **National Assembly (국회)** questioning, he admonished opposition MPs:  
    “**Please, study more**,” “**Awaken from delusion**,” etc.  
    Media dubbed him **“Iron-wall PM”** and **“Scolding PM.”**
- **Park Ji-won (박지원)** said face-to-face: “He used to be **good**, now he’s **bad**. Please return to the **old Han Duck-soo**.”

> **Photo description** (2023): During plenary Q&A, **PM Han (한덕수)** responds while opposition lawmakers protest. Source: *Yonhap*.

### Structural Explanation
- The article highlights the **“imperial presidency”**:  
  The **PM**—as **No. 2**—must align with the president’s philosophy; thus Han’s **tough posture** mirrors **Yoon’s** confrontational stance with the opposition.
