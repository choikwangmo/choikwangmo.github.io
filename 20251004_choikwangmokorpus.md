## 4. Major Concepts (Latent Knowledge)

* **Chuseok (추석) Retail Operations in Korea (대한민국)**
  Chuseok is a major national holiday; large malls often adjust hours (e.g., late opening) and some anchors (e.g., warehouse clubs) may close on the day. Crowd levels typically peak before and after the holiday; parking and queue management policies are often tightened.

* **Card Promotion Mechanics in Korean Retail (신용카드 프로모션 관행)**
  Threshold-based benefits (e.g., spend KRW 100k/200k/300k to receive KRW 10k/20k/30k vouchers) are common. Eligibility is restricted by issuer and card type; corporate and prepaid/check cards are frequently excluded. Benefits usually require same-day receipts presented by the purchaser; “split receipts” are typically disallowed to prevent artificial threshold gaming. Overlap with other benefits is commonly restricted.

* **F&B Voucher (식음료 이용권) Usage Norms**
  Vouchers at food courts or curated dining zones (e.g., Gourmet Street (고메스트리트)) typically have face value (e.g., KRW 10k/20k/30k) and stated validity periods and usage locations. Change is often not provided if the spend is below face value; partial redemption rules vary by issuer/venue.

* **Membership Verification & Redemption (멤버십 검증/혜택 수령)**
  Retailers often require app-based membership login/QR for benefit issuance. Non-members may redeem at information desks (e.g., “1F Customer Center”) with stricter ID/receipt checks. Same-day, same-person verification is standard.

* **VAT (부가가치세) Basics in Korea**
  Standard VAT rate is typically 10% for domestic retail goods/services. Sales receipts display taxable base and VAT separately; card slips (카드매출전표) function as proof of purchase for consumers and may be used for simplified expense claims, while tax invoices (세금계산서) are required for B2B input VAT deductions. Promotional notices like this SMS do not constitute tax invoices.

* **Credit Card Approval Slip (카드매출전표) & Proof**
  A card approval slip usually shows approval number, date/time, merchant ID, amount (including VAT), and masked card details (only last 4 digits visible). For promotions, customers are often asked to show the slip or aggregated same-day receipts to claim benefits.

* **Event Scheduling & Capacity (이벤트 운영 관행)**
  Free shows (e.g., balloon shows, parades) often run at fixed slots (e.g., 14:00/16:00). First-come-first-served seating, queue lines, and on-site staff guidance are common. Photography areas and brief safety notices (especially around parades) are typical.

* **Pet Park (펫파크) Operations**
  Shopping-mall pet parks commonly require leash control, owner responsibility, and sometimes proof of vaccinations; breed/muzzle guidelines may apply. Special lectures (e.g., by veterinarians) usually require prior registration; seating is limited.

* **Class Booking Platforms & No-Show Policies (클래스 예약 관행)**
  Platforms like Classkok (클래스콕) host brand-collaboration classes; no-show and cancellation windows are typically defined in the platform policy. Brand tie-ins (e.g., Hanyul (한율)) often include trial kits or gifts for participants.

* **Mobile Advertising Compliance Markers (모바일 광고 표기)**
  “Ad (광고)” prefix and “Web sender (웹발신)” tags are standard identifiers in Korea. A free opt-out phone number (e.g., 080-xxxx-xxxx) is commonly provided to comply with local marketing communication norms.
