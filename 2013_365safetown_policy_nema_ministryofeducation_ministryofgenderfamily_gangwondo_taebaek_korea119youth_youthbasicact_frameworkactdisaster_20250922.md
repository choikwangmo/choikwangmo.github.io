---

## Document Purpose (as written on the title spread, pages 2–3)
- In response to the confirmed national governance orientation of the 18th Park Geun-hye Administration, the document seeks strategies that, through a strategic response to the paradigm shift in safety-experience policy, will firmly establish “365 SafeTown (365세이프타운)” as Korea’s representative safety-experience facility (domestically and internationally).
- “Safety is not learning but experience, and a duty” — phrase marked for strategic dissemination.

## 1. National Governance Orientation (국정기조, page 2)
- National governance orientation: Includes a social-development paradigm (from “safety insensitivity” to “safety first”).
- National goals (vision): Four pillars toward a safe and integrated society (prevention and systematic management of disasters and calamities).
- 140 national tasks: Seven tasks selected under the heading of “strengthening a comprehensive national disaster-management system.”

## 2. SWOT Analysis and Strengthening Directions (pages 2–3)

### 2.1 SWOT Table
| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|
| Korea’s only safety-experience theme park combining “experience center + school.” | Accessibility disadvantage for capital-region and Honam-region tourists (long distance). |
| New-concept edutainment facility (experience + education) with diverse, engaging content. | City image disadvantage (coal-mining city, distance) acting as a weakness. |
| Simultaneous accommodation of large groups (1,000+). | Short replacement cycle of video content; high reinforcement costs. |
| Three districts allow distribution of specialized facilities by district. | Simulator facilities—advantages but also constraints (hard to upgrade; fixed installations). |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---|---|
| Inclusion of “safety” within the national policy agenda (expectations for institutionalization). | Cities and provinces building similar facilities: Jeollabuk-do (임실), Chungcheongnam-do (천안), etc. (per the National Basic Plan for Safety Management—~20 billion KRW scale each). |
| Gradual spread of recognition for the necessity of safety-experience facilities. | New facilities may benchmark this center’s content, weakening competitiveness. |
| Specialization as a safety-experience facility capable of handling large groups. | Drafting of standard manuals by the National Emergency Management Agency (소방방재청) may lead to outflow of know-how. |
| Growing demand for safety-experience across various demographics; moves to strengthen school experiential activities (policy changes). |  |

### 2.2 Strengthening Directions (SWOT-based, page 3)
- Continuously underscore the importance of safety-experience to related ministries and schools; pursue differentiation and institutionalization.
- Promote specialized products—such as the Safety Experience Center and the Snow Festival—to improve the city image associated with distance.

## 3. Major Challenges to Overcome (page 3)

- Institutionalization of safety-experience  
  - Multi-ministry negotiations (by sector) make progress difficult; ministries cited include the Ministry of Security and Public Administration (안전행정부), Ministry of Education (교육부), Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (여성가족부), and National Emergency Management Agency (소방방재청). [^note-yeom]
- Pluralization of negotiation channels  
  - Formerly: unified government negotiation window (Ministry of Security and Public Administration comprehensive coordination → Presidential Committee on Social Security (현대위) context).  
  - Currently: multi-ministry working-level consultations; a lack of comprehensive coordination.
- Standardization of safety-experience centers (excluding this center from the target scope while counting Seoul×2, Daegu×1, Jeonbuk×1)  
  - NEMA (소방방재청) is discussing a standard manual; most centers operate under metropolitan/provincial fire headquarters, but this facility is operated by a basic municipality (Taebaek City (태백시)), thus not included in the discussion—continued, multi-angle petitions requested.
- Weak external leverage at central ministries  
  - Working-level, bureau-by-bureau talks are weak in external negotiation power; propose raising interest and leveraging elected officials and human networks.
- Ambiguity in Gangwon-do (강원도) coordination and support system  
  - Budget support: Resource Development Division (자원개발과; coal region development funds).  
  - Personnel support: Fire Headquarters (소방본부; instructor dispatch).  
  - Under the revised Government Organization Act, operational matters for safety-experience centers are judged to be under fire headquarters. Example: Daegu Metropolitan City’s enforcement rules specify responsibilities under the Fire and Safety Headquarters.
- Diversification of experience programs (content)  
  - Beyond the five safety-experience halls + Challenge facility, development of additional programs is lagging.  
  - Initial design: experience center + safety (fire) school + outdoor (rigorous) facility.  
  - Current: experience center + outdoor facility + fire school (limited operation).  
  - Large-group dispersion programs are weak; extra budget and staffing needed for early reinforcement, thus difficult.  
  - Seeking approaches: utilize the Tourism Development Fund (관광개발기금), bolster the 3D theater, etc.

## 4. Strategic Negotiation Agenda by Ministry (부처별 전략적 협의과제, pages 4–5)

| Ministry / Body (original) | Department / Team (original) | Strategic negotiation items (translated line-by-line) |
|---|---|---|
| Ministry of Security and Public Administration (안전행정부) | National Safety Management Headquarters, Safety Policy Bureau (정책과) | Institutionalize safety-experience education as part of “safety culture” promotion; propose reflecting national policy orientation in laws/regulations (`법령개정`). |
| National Emergency Management Agency (소방방재청) | 119 Rescue & EMS Bureau; Life Safety Division (생활안전과) | Propose strengthening institutions reflecting national orientation toward safety; propose institutional options such as establishing a public corporation; designate the Safety Experience Center as a Civil Defense Training certifying body; encourage employees of related agencies to undergo experience-based training (institutionalize); link with Korea Fire Safety Association (소방안전협회), Korea 119 Youth (한국119소년단), etc.; demand inclusion of this center as the representative model in the “Safety Experience Center Standard Manual”; expand institution-based “experience-style safety education” (accreditation). |
| Gangwon-do Fire Headquarters (강원도 소방본부/지원단) | — | Ongoing coordination for operational linkage. |
| Ministry of Economy and Finance (기획재정부); Financial Supervisory Service (금융감독원) | Economic Policy Bureau; Planning & Coordination; Money Market Division; External Cooperation Team | Encourage insurance associations and related bodies to adopt safety-experience programs (accident prevention value; social-cost savings). |
| Ministry of Education (교육부) | Local Education Support Bureau; Local Education Autonomy Division | Institutionalize school-oriented, experience-type safety education; grant partial points to those completing experience education (accreditation / certification); foster university clubs (experts), and recommend OT/MT settings utilizing experience education. |
| Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (여성가족부) | Youth Policy Office; Youth Activity Promotion Division | Institutionalize completion of safety-experience education for youth organizations; reflect national policy; interlink with the Ministry of Education, etc. |
| Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (문화체육관광부) | Tourism Bureau; Tourism Policy Division | Link vouchers and tourism–culture projects to encourage safety-experience (coordinate with Korea Tourism Organization (한국관광공사) to operate linked products). |
| Ministry of Health and Welfare (보건복지부) | Population Policy Office; Child Rights Division | For programs targeting specific groups (e.g., Dream Start), recommend specialized safety-experience programs. |
| Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (산업통상자원부) | Industrial Economy Policy (관/과); Operations Support Division | Encourage affiliated agencies/organizations to adopt safety-experience programs; recommend training for ministries/subordinate bodies and companies (including Federation of Korean Industries). |
| Small and Medium Business Administration (중소기업청) | Corporate Training Institute Establishment TF | Recommend corporate training programs that include safety-experience; encourage “family safety-experience camps”; encourage use for new-hire OT and corporate MT. Note: Center’s own programs need stronger competitiveness; discover city-wide linked programs (e.g., Taebaeksan (태백산), springhead trekking + Safety Experience Center). |
| Gangwon-do (강원도) | Resource Development Division; Fire Headquarters; Tourism & Culture Division | Propose attracting linked experience programs and seminars by each department; strengthen strategic ties. Analyze status and diversify action plans; raise interest across all departments. |

- Editorial note: “Reflect revisions to the Government Organization Act; pursue early, strategic approaches.” (footnote on page 5).

## 5. Forward Strategy (향후전략, pages 5–6)

- Comprehensive strategy: Single-department (Experience Center) comprehensive promotion is realistically difficult; seek “amplification” of external outcomes through joint efforts to reflect policies by department.
- Promotion system: By institution and actor; ministry-to-ministry (man-to-man), step-by-step.
  - Role-sharing by promoting institutions (use roundtables): continuously strengthen roles of elected officials (e.g., National Assembly), Gangwon-do, key local institutions/organizations, and citizens.
  - By working unit: Strategic responses by project teams.  
    - Example: link specific projects such as Dream Start, voucher projects, and youth experiential learning. [^ex1]
- Method: Phase 1—send materials and visit related institutions of 365 SafeTown → Phase 2—department-by-department approach.
- Departmental approaches:  
  - Cooperation: send official letters and conduct visits; request cooperation for seminars/workshops; gradually increase external exposure to promote the specialized facility for safety-experience and spread recognition of its importance/necessity.  
  - Social-contribution program linkage: encourage affiliated organizations and corporations to adopt experience-based training as social contribution and morale boosting (employee) programs. Examples include “Surviving Disaster with Your Family,” “The 4-minute Miracle (CPR),” and “If You Know Just This, You Can Save a Life.” [^ex2]  
  - Policy proposals: craft ministry-specific proposals for linkable programs (e.g., for youth organizations—“Surviving Disaster,” rigorous-experience courses, disaster-overcoming programs; connect with probation youth rigorous programs).
- Next steps: After reorganization under the revised Government Organization Act, send related documents by ministry following the policy orientation; develop external PR activities (linked with Members of the National Assembly).

## 6. Administrative Matters (행정사항, page 6)
- [ ] All departments: actively discover safety-experience education programs and explore diverse linkage options.
- [ ] 2013 “365 SafeTown Comprehensive Marketing Execution Plan” (Experience Center-679, dated 2013-02-05): strongly request each department to carry out cooperation items.
