Below is my attempt to act as a “박용민 Metadata Extractor” under your system prompt. Because public data on him is limited, some parts are “unknown” or “inferred with low confidence.” I also include an audit log of assumptions and gaps.

## Part A. Human-Readable Summary

As of late 2024 / 2025, he serves as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Korea (ROK) to Thailand, stationed in Bangkok. He emphasizes leveraging “soft power,” cultural exchange, and public communication to deepen Korea–Thailand ties and promote Korea’s global image.

* Over the years: various overseas postings including United States, Oman, Indonesia, Japan, and at Korea’s UN mission (New York) ([eliteplusmagazine.com][2])

* August 2025: attends opening of “2025 Korea Tourism Roadshow” in Bangkok, promotes inbound tourism to Korea ([외교부][5])

**Affiliations, Roles and Authority**

* Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Korea (career diplomat)
* Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Thailand (term from ~2023/late → ongoing) ([경향신문][3])
* Former roles: “Multilateral & Global Affairs” Deputy Minister / Coordinator (or similar) ([eliteplusmagazine.com][2])
* Past overseas missions: Korea’s UN mission, embassies to Oman, Indonesia, Japan (publicly referenced) ([eliteplusmagazine.com][2])

**Outputs and Signature Works / Initiatives**

* Public speeches on “Soft Power / Cultural Diplomacy” (e.g. Stamford “Meet the Ambassador” event) ([stamford.edu][6])
* Signing of “Korea–Thailand Nuclear Cooperation Agreement” (as ambassador) ([외교부][7])

**Media and Platforms**

* YouTube: “Meet the Ambassador: H.E. Mr. Park Yongmin” — talk on soft power / cultural diplomacy ([YouTube][10])
* Press coverage in Thai / Korean media: e.g. Bangkok Post “Thai-Korean ties: Building on solid foundations” quotes him on history and bilateral ties ([방콕 포스트][11])
* Instagram: @yongmin_park_th (personal / official hybrid) with posts relating to his ambassador role ([Instagram][12])

**Concepts, Keywords and Theories**

* Soft power / Cultural diplomacy
* Public diplomacy, narrative diplomacy, people-to-people exchange
* Film / art as empathy tool in diplomacy (“to live another life” analogy) ([매일경제][13])
* Promotion of tourism / Korean culture (K-beauty, K-food, K-festival)

**Network, Collaboration and Influence**

* Interactions with Thai foreign ministry officials (e.g. Piyapak Sricharoen) ([สถานเอกอัครราชทูต ณ กรุงโซล][4])
* Collaborations with Korean universities (e.g. Jeonbuk National University in Thai campus project) ([Korea Joongang Daily][14])
* Engagement with local cultural / educational institutions (Stamford University, Mahidol IRGA event) ([stamford.edu][6])

**Incidents, Controversies and Crises**

* No clear evidence of major scandals or controversies in the available sources
* Some mention in Thai media of “backlash from Thai public over alleged treatment of Thai tourists at Korean borders” that he addressed diplomatically (in context of bilateral sensitivity) ([thai.news][15])

**Comparators and Benchmarks**

* Compared to other diplomatic figures who combine cultural diplomacy (e.g. public intellectual-diplomats)
* Benchmark peers: senior ambassadors from other East Asian / ASEAN countries who emphasize soft power
* Compared against Korea’s foreign service norms: his more pronounced cultural/communications role is somewhat distinctive

**Reception, Reputation and Metrics**

* Generally positive media framing: characterized as bridging culture & diplomacy, “reshaping Thai–Korean relations” ([thai.news][15])
* Impact in promotional events: the Korea Tourism Roadshow in Bangkok drew ~70,000 visitors over two days ([외교부][5])
* No quantified metrics of diplomatic success publicly shown (e.g. increase in trade, tourism links specifically tied to him)

**Law, Standards and Regulations Mapping**

* As ambassador: functions under diplomatic conventions (Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations)
* Signing Korea–Thailand Nuclear Cooperation Agreement — must comply with nuclear nonproliferation treaties / IAEA safeguards (not in sources) ([외교부][7])

**Data Quality, Ambiguities and Limits**

* Many claims are from press / embassy press releases → secondary or tertiary sources
* Some internal Ministry titles (e.g. “Multilateral & Global Affairs”) are translated / interpreted
* Birthdate (year) is known; full birthdate, early life, family are not publicly confirmed in reliable sources
* External authority IDs (Wikidata, VIAF, ORCID) not located in the search results → unknown

**Similar-Trajectory Juxtaposition**

* One plausible comparator: a diplomat with both policy and cultural/public diplomacy roles (e.g. another Korean cultural-public diplomacy ambassador)
* Shared motifs might include: hybrid diplomat-communicator path, cross-regional assignment, culture-driven diplomacy
* Key difference: his heavier reliance on public cultural narrative in Thai context
* Counterexample: a diplomat focused purely on economic / security diplomacy with minimal public-facing cultural role

## Part F. Audit Log

**Automated extraction rules summary**

* Recognize patterns like “~년 입부,” “신임 대사 ~ 선임” as key transitions
* Names normalized to “English (native)” per bilingual proper noun rule
* Urn scheme used for IDs (e.g. `urn:person:…`)
* Press / official site scraping for event dates and roles

**Manual corrections / interventions**

* Interpreted “다자외교조정관” as “Multilateral Diplomacy Coordinator / Deputy Minister for multilateral and global affairs” — translation not always precise
* In JSON-LD, I omitted unspecified fields (e.g. exact birth day) as “unknown”
* For external IDs (Wikidata, VIAF), I left them blank because none found in initial search

**Remaining queries / missing items**

* Full birth date (month/day)
* Early life / education details (e.g. undergraduate institution, years) beyond what the Kyobo summary gives
* Exact titles and durations of all internal MFA roles
* External authority identifiers (Wikidata QID, VIAF, ORCID)
* More detailed metrics on his diplomatic impact (trade increase, tourist flows linked to his initiatives)
* Comparable diplomats for similarity juxtaposition

**Limits and bias notes**

* Reliance on media/press releases means possible positive bias (official narratives)
* Lack of independent scholarly coverage limits critical perspective
* Gaps in private / less public aspects (family, early career)
* Media sources in Korean / Thai may not always be fully accessible / verifiable globally

**Similarity juxtaposition log**

* Seed candidates: not explicitly given; ideally diplomats combining cultural/public diplomacy (e.g. past Korean cultural ambassadors)
* Weights (if public_service domain): state 0.3, event 0.25, network 0.2, concept 0.15, geo 0.1
* Here only one weak candidate was conceptually sketched (no strong match found in public sources)
* No strong similarity (≥0.7) candidate identified
* Common motif: diplomat + cultural narrative + regional bridging
* Difference: he has a particularly visible public / tourism / cultural event presence

If you like, I can now **apply one of the RAG-based analytical frameworks** (from before) using this extracted metadata to produce a full diachronic, multidimensional analysis of Park Yong-min. Do you want me to do that next?
