## I. Significance of Establishing the Future Development Strategy

### 1) Nature and Status of the Plan
- A mid-to-long-term plan setting the development direction and vision for the fire safety service of Gangwon Province (Gangwon-do (강원도)).  
- An innovation plan for fire services to reduce risks and inconveniences in residents’ daily lives.  
- A top-level comprehensive plan linking long-term vision, mid-term plan, and annual roadmap.  
- A collaborative capability-building plan created with participation of all staff.

### 2) Background and Purpose
- Create sustainable, Gangwon-style fire services addressing local social issues (e.g., population decline) and discovering new growth engines.  
- Present a blueprint that fulfills residents’ safety expectations following nationalization of the fire service in April 2020.  
- Build a future-oriented organization prepared for new disaster types and technological change, including pandemic risks.

### 3) Strategic Direction
- Reflect national/provincial visions and goals; build an integrated disaster management system with stronger on-site response capabilities.  
- Adopt approaches aligned with residents’ expectations, protecting comprehensive “safety rights” (risk removal, inconvenience reduction, vulnerable groups’ welfare).  
- Two-track design: strengthen individual competencies and organizational capabilities (on-site response, leadership, potential development).  
- Choose implementable strategies reflecting residents’ values; evaluate feasibility of each detailed plan.

### 4) Scope of the Plan
- **Temporal**: Short-term 2021–2022; Mid/Long-term 2023–2030.  
- **Spatial**: Entire Gangwon-do (18 cities/counties; 16,873.26 ㎢).  
- **Content**: Comprehensive fire services including response, safety, and welfare.
