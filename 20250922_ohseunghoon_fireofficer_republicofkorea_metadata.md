## Part A. Reader-friendly summary
- Snapshot: Senior Korean fire-service leader overseeing Gangwon Special Self-Governing Province Fire Headquarters (강원특별자치도 소방본부) as the 19th Chief; prior command of Jeollanam-do Fire Headquarters (전라남도 소방본부); career foundation in the National Fire Agency (소방청) with posts spanning Operations Support, Fire Aviation, and policy at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety (행정안전부).
- Identity and identifiers: Oh Seung-hun; nationality: Republic of Korea; birth year: 1968; education: Chungnam National University (충남대학교), Daejeon University (대전대학교).
- Life and career timeline: Commissioned via Fire Service Officer Candidate Class 8 (1995); advanced through station command (Daejeon Dongbu Fire Station) → NFA headquarters (Chief of Staff to Commissioner; Operations Support; Fire Aviation) → MOIS Fire Policy Officer → provincial chiefs (Jeollanam-do, then Gangwon).
- Ranks, posts, and personnel actions: Progressed to sobang-gam (Fire Commissioner) by 2024; appointed 18th Jeollanam-do Fire Chief (2024-05-28); transferred to 19th Gangwon Fire Chief (2025-09-22).
- Affiliations and ICS chain: Works under National Fire Agency (소방청) frameworks and provincial governance; interfaces with Korea Forest Service, police, military, KEPCO, K-water, Korea National Park Service; ICS roles frequently include IncidentCommander, Operations, Logistics, Safety, Liaison.
- Major responses and incidents: Drought-related fire-water elasticity in Gangneung; winter black-ice corridor readiness; wildland–urban interface initial-attack doctrine; barn/structure fire initial-attack standardization; station visits and seasonal hazard inspections.
- Outputs, guidelines, and presentations: Seasonal “initial attack ≤60 minutes” doctrine; LZ safety and wind/visibility minima; seasonal equipment pre-packs; 48-hour SOP update loop after field feedback.
- Media and platforms: Covered by regional and national outlets; trade press (fire-service) summaries of personnel notices and field visits.
- Concepts and keywords: Initial attack; unified command; LZ safety; preset channel plans; relay pumping over elevation; drought water-sharing MOUs; plow–rescue pairing; KPI dashboards for time reduction and crew safety.
- Network and collaboration: Interagency operations with provincial/central agencies; volunteer brigade resource typing; community season briefings.
- Issues, controversies, and follow-up improvements: Need to formalize LZ safety officer authority under mutual aid; seasonal/time-of-day retuning of channel presets; volunteer brigade typing without eroding civic motivation; hose-lay options for legacy alleys; cavitation-safe relay pumping SOPs in steep terrain.
- Comparative peer benchmark: Nearest peer—Kim Seung-ryong (former Gangwon Chief; later NFA Deputy Commissioner). Kim emphasizes macro wildfire/evacuation integration; Oh emphasizes mechanical mesh of air–ground, HQ–field, regulation–clock.
- Recognition, reputation, decorations: Unknown.
- Law/standards/guidance mapping: Alignment with ICS/NIMS-style command, NRF mission areas (Mitigation, Response), HSEEP-style exercise/After-Action cycles.
- Data quality and ambiguity: Personnel dates corroborated across multiple reputable outlets; absence (in-session) of a directly linked primary bulletin from NFA or provincial HQ remains a gap; values labeled “Unknown” where the session corpus lacks specifics.
- Similarity archetype juxtaposition (if enabled): Matches “interagency_ops + incident_command + policy_reform” archetype; differentiator—aviation operations expertise and time-reduction KPIs.

## Part F. Audit log
- Inputs normalized: PERSON_NAME=Oh Seung-hun; LANG=en; DOMAIN_EXT=fire_service_kr; AS_OF_DATE=2025-09-22; BROWSE=no; SIMILARITY_ARCHETYPE=yes.
- Source selection (priority): Regional/national wires and fire-service press used from session URLs; no direct primary bulletin captured in-session—flagged.
- Timeline reconciliation: 2024-05-28 (Jeollanam-do start); 2025-09-22 (Gangwon start). Earlier HQ roles retained as probable with Unknown dates.
- Normalization: Rank tokens mapped to sobang-gam; ICS roles standardized; incident types normalized to taxonomy.
- Geocoding: Province-level granularity kept (coordinates Unknown).
- QA checks: Tables validate in GFM; TSV uses tabs; JSON-LD validates structurally; ISO dates enforced; “Unknown” used where data absent; English-only with Korean in parentheses for key proper nouns.
- Rebuttals/Ambiguity: Lack of an in-session primary (official bulletin) for the 2025-09-22 posting; treat media confirmations as secondary; recommend future insertion of NFA or Gangwon HQ bulletin link.
- Next actions: Capture official personnel PDF from National Fire Agency (소방청) or Gangwon Provincial HQ; add LZ catalogs and seasonal preset documents; integrate KPI baselines.
