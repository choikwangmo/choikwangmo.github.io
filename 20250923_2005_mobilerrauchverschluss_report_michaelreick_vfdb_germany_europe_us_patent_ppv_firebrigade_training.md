# Dr.-Ing. Michael Reick and the Mobile Smoke Curtain (Mobiler Rauchverschluss): Development and Impact

## Overview
- Subject: The conception, development, patenting, standardization, and global adoption of the Mobile Smoke Curtain (Mobiler Rauchverschluss, MRV).
- Focus: Protecting stairwells and egress routes from smoke spread during interior firefighting; combining MRV with positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) and flow-path control.

---

## Background and Early Research (Early 2000s)
- Michael Reick (마이클 라이크), an engineer educated at the University of Stuttgart (슈투트가르트 대학) and a career firefighter for 25+ years, investigated smoke movement in buildings and the challenge of keeping stairwells clear during multi-story fires.
- Problem identification: PPV alone could not fully prevent smoke inflow into stairwells at the moment of door opening.
- 2004: Conducted computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of smoke spread when opening doors and examined PPV limits.
- Resulting need: A simple, fast, repeatable method to manage the doorway opening itself to reduce smoke spread into protected routes.
- Concept formed: “Mobile Smoke Curtain (Mobiler Rauchverschluss, MRV)” as a portable, rapidly installed barrier at doorways to retain hot smoke in the fire compartment while permitting limited low-level intake for visibility and stability.

---

## Prototype Trials and Early Field Use (2004–2006)
- 2005 (September): Trial use in a North Rhine–Westphalia (노르트라인-베스트팔렌주, Germany) training building demonstrated feasibility.
- 2005 (November): WMF Geislingen plant fire brigade carried out installation drills with double fire doors and verified effectiveness.
- 2006 (February 6, Heilbronn (하일브론), Germany): In a multi-family dwelling fire, the MRV kept the stairwell clear despite severe damage in the apartment and hallway.

---

## Adoption in the German Fire System (2005–2010)
- Mid-2005: Product launch (“Markteinführung”) followed by rapid uptake across volunteer, career, and industrial brigades.
- Acceptance: Unusually high for a new device; framed as an extension of existing tactics, enabling immediate integration after short training.
- Leadership context: Reick served as county fire chief for Göppingen (괴핑겐) in Baden-Württemberg (바덴뷔르템베르크주) from 1999, facilitating training and field implementation.

## Patents and Productization
- Patents:
  - Germany/EU: DE102005001211A1 (publication), with international filing PCT/EP2006/000091.
  - United States: US 7,810,576 B2 (2010).
- Productization:
  - Collaboration with established fire-equipment manufacturers (e.g., rescue-tec) for early production and supply.
  - Subsequent production by multiple vendors (e.g., GFD, Dönges), including in Austria (오스트리아) and Switzerland (스위스).
  - Iterations introduced “PRO” versions and improvements such as higher one-time direct-flame endurance (up to 600℃), detachable gaskets, and telescopic frames.
  - Licensing in some regions; parallel product naming (e.g., Tempest PathMaster in the U.S.).

---

## Standardization and Tactics (2010s)
- Standard equipment: MRV became a “Standardgerät” in Germany (독일), loaded on first-out engines (e.g., HLF/LF) across many states.
- Equipment lists: State-level specifications list MRV; e.g., Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (메클렌부르크-포어포메른) LF 20 loading lists.
- Guidance: MRV usage appears in national/regional tactical publications (e.g., FwDV references and regional technical directives, including TRH-StLF 20:2023 (Hesse, 헤센)) as part of flow-path control and stairwell protection.

---

## Equipment Design and Operating Principle
- Structure:
  - Lightweight tension frame (often aluminum) expands into the door frame.
  - Flame-retardant, heat-resistant fabric curtain seals the upper opening; overlapping lower/side sections allow hose and personnel passage with quick reseal.
- Mechanism of control:
  - Upper sealing retains hot, toxic smoke layer; limited low-level intake supports visibility and combustion stability.
  - Compatible with PPV and push–pull venting to maintain positive pressure in the stairwell/egress.
- Field benefits:
  - Maintains stairwell visibility/tenability.
  - Enables concurrent rescue and fire attack.
  - Reduces smoke contamination beyond the fire compartment.

## Operational SOP (Field Use)
1. **Decision**: Use MRV when door opening risks contaminating stairwells/egress with smoke.
2. **Preparation**: Ready frame and curtain; clear obstructions; communicate with potential evacuees.
3. **Installation**: Expand frame into jamb; deploy curtain; ensure upper seal; align lower overlaps.
4. **Entry/Attack**: Pass hose/personnel through overlaps briefly; reseal immediately; use TIC as needed.
5. **Ventilation Integration**: Operate PPV; establish push–pull routes from fire room out; maintain stairwell positive pressure.
6. **Monitoring**: Watch for deformation/leakage; adjust tactics if temperature increases or combustion becomes unstable.
7. **Demobilization**: Remove after knockdown; decon, dry, inspect; document damage and replace if required.

- **France**: Paris Fire Brigade (BSPP) adopted MRV for high-rise operations.
- **United Kingdom**: After the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, stairwell smoke control gained emphasis; the 2020 interim recommendations cited Reick’s 2005 work. Pilots and subsequent adoption increased across England (잉글랜드) and Scotland (스코틀랜드).
- **North America**:
  - Post-2014 FDIC exposure, U.S. departments explored “flow-path” control with smoke curtains (e.g., FDNY’s KO Curtain concept for high-rise operations).
  - Coverage in *Fire Rescue* and *Fire Engineering* highlighted MRV’s potential to reduce air supply to the fire, moderate heat release, and delay flashover.
  - Adoption and research expanded in major U.S./Canadian departments.
- **Scale**: By 2020, cumulative global deployments surpassed 40,000 units.

## Advantages and Limitations
- Advantages:
  - Maintains egress tenability and visibility.
  - Facilitates simultaneous rescue and attack.
  - Synergizes with PPV/push–pull ventilation.
  - Simple, rapid, and repeatable deployment; minimal additional staffing.
- Limitations and cautions:
  - **Not** a substitute for fire doors or compartmentation.
  - Performance depends on heat flux and duration of direct flame exposure.
  - Pinch/entanglement risk during installation; minimize curtain opening time for evacuees and crews.
  - Reuse requires proper decon and inspection; follow single-use/disposal criteria where specified.
