# Taebaek Cheongsong Apartment — Monthly Maintenance Bill

**Unit:** Building 106, Apt. 905
**Billing Month:** August 2025 (Aug 1–31, 2025)
**Due Date:** September 30, 2025

**Payee / Account:** NH Bank 330534-56-000378 (Cheongsong Apartments Residents’ Association)
**Issuer:** Management Office (☎ 033-553-3072)

## A) Your Unit’s Line Items (what they mean)

* **General Administration Fee** — Office ops, staff/admin overhead, stationery, postage, software, bank fees, etc.
* **Cleaning Service Fee** — Contracted janitorial services for common areas (lobbies, corridors, stairwells, parking, waste rooms).

* **Hot Water** — Unit’s domestic hot-water usage.
* **Electricity (Unit)** — Unit meter reading.
* **Water (Unit)** — Unit consumption in tons (㎥).
* **Sewer (Unit)** — Usually a function of water usage under local tariff.
* **Misc. Income Deduction (–)** — Your unit’s credit from common revenues (e.g., antenna/site rental, vending, recycling proceeds), often distributed pro-rata.
* **Long-Term Repair Reserve (Contribution)** — Monthly capital reserve deposit for future “big ticket” projects (roofing, elevator replacement, piping, etc.).
  **→ Sum for this month:** **₩105,930**

## B) Estate-Wide Snapshot (for context)

# Added Expert Context (general knowledge in Korea)

### 1) How costs are typically allocated

* **Common vs. exclusive items:**

  * *Common* (security, cleaning, elevator, common electricity/water) are apportioned by an approved rule—**most commonly by exclusive floor area (㎡)** or by a blended formula set in the complex’s management regulations.
  * *Exclusive (unit) usage* (your electricity/water/hot water/gas) is charged by **actual meter readings** and applicable tariffs.
* **Pro-rata credits (“miscellaneous income”):**

  * Revenue from shared assets (e.g., base-station rooftop rent, machine room leases, recyclables) is typically pooled and **credited back** to households using the same pro-rata method as common costs (often by floor area). That’s the small “negative” line on your bill.

### 2) What’s inside the big common buckets

* **Security:** mainly guard wages, with add-ons like uniforms, holidays/night differentials, and guard-room utilities. Outsourced under a service contract.
* **Cleaning:** multi-year contracts with scope by building count/area; sometimes includes periodic deep-cleans (garage pressure-wash, window washing).
* **Elevator:** a fixed **monthly maintenance fee per car**, plus **emergency phone line lease**, and **periodic safety inspections**. Any **major replacements** (e.g., traction machine, controller, door operator) are **capital** and funded from the long-term reserve or a special levy if the reserve is short.
* **Disinfection / sanitation:** scheduled pest control; building-wide disinfection (more frequent in summer); septic-tank service where applicable.

### 3) Tariffs and metering (what to expect)

* **Electricity:**

  * *Unit electricity* follows the residential tariff; **common electricity** covers corridor/parking/yard lights, pumps, elevators, CCTV, etc. Separate meters exist for these categories.
  * Billing windows (e.g., **Jul 18–Aug 18**) won’t always match the calendar month of the management bill; statements align them operationally.
* **Water / Sewer:**

  * Water is billed in **tons (㎥)** with block tariffs by the local utility; the sewer fee is calculated from the water volume according to municipal rules.
* **Hot water / Heating:**

  * Central systems apportion costs by **heat meter (GJ)** or by **hot-water meter (㎥)** and published unit rates; off-season heating is typically zero.

### 4) Long-Term Repair Reserve (how it’s governed in practice)

* **Purpose:** planned renewals (e.g., elevators, roofing, waterproofing, facade sealant, fire pump, heating mains).
* **Funding:** fixed **monthly contributions** per unit (commonly based on exclusive area).
* **Use of funds:** projects follow a **plan and lifecycle** (e.g., elevator ~15–20 yrs; roof membranes ~10–15 yrs, depending on spec).
* **Approvals & disclosure:** spending usually requires **resident or committee approval** per the complex’s management regulations, with **post-disclosure** of bids, contracts, and outcomes.
* **If reserve is insufficient:** a **temporary special assessment** may be levied (separate from monthly fees).

### 5) Governance & transparency you can expect as a resident

* **Annual budgets & closing:** management offices prepare a **yearly budget** and later publish **settlement statements**; deviations vs. budget are explained.
* **Vendor selection:** major service contracts (security/cleaning/elevator) are **tendered** under the complex’s procurement rules; basic contract info (term, fee, vendor) is shared with residents.
* **Dispute/queries:** residents can request **supporting documents** (invoices, meter photos/summaries) for reasonableness checks within a prescribed window; corrections are reflected in the next cycle.
* **Delinquency handling:** late fees and escalation steps are laid out in the management rules (notice → restriction of certain amenities where lawful → legal collection).

### 6) Seasonal & practical considerations

* **Summer spikes:** common electricity (elevators, lobby A/C, pumps) and **disinfection** often peak in summer months.
* **Winter spikes:** heating/hot water shoot up if centrally supplied.
* **Elevator/roof timing:** many complexes **front-load reserve** contributions before large cyclical projects; you might see **stable monthly contributions** but **lumpy capital outflows** in specific months when works execute.

### 7) Quick self-audit tips (resident level)

* Compare **unit electricity/water** against your **last 3–6 months** to spot anomalies.
* Check the **per-car elevator maintenance fee** × number of cars (plus emergency lines & inspections) against what’s disclosed.
* Look at **common kWh per household** trend month-over-month (seasonally). Unexplained jumps can signal lighting schedules, pump issues, or meter timing.
* Confirm **long-term reserve contribution** matches what’s approved for your unit class (by exclusive area).
* Keep an eye on **misc. income credits**—small but steady; sudden changes should have an explanation (e.g., contract renewal of rooftop lease).

---

## Your data (recap) + how to use this context

* Your payable: **₩105,930** for Aug 2025, driven mainly by **Long-Term Repair Reserve (₩49,330)**, then **Unit Electricity (₩18,420)** and **Hot Water (₩16,065)**.
* Estate-wide totals indicate normal seasonal patterns (notably common electricity and disinfection in summer).
* Use the checklists above if you want to verify reasonableness or ask the office for a detail sheet (they can provide meter summaries and vendor invoices).

---

If you want, I can:

* turn this into a **clean Excel** with formulas (so you can plug in different usage and instantly see the bill), or
* produce a **one-page English PDF** you can send to others.

## 4. Major Concepts (Latent Knowledge)

### Value-Added Tax (Korea)

* **Definition & rate:** VAT is a consumption tax levied on most goods/services in Korea. The **standard rate is 10%**.
* **Calculation:** Taxable supply value × 10% = VAT; totals are rounded to the nearest KRW. Receipts commonly show “Taxable Supply” and “VAT” as separate lines plus a “Total.”
* **Inclusions/Exclusions:** Most retail goods are taxable; certain items (e.g., some unprocessed foods, export sales) can be zero-rated or exempt, but department-store apparel/gift goods are ordinarily taxed at 10%.
* **Documentation:** For businesses, a **tax invoice** (세금계산서) or **cash receipt** (현금영수증) is used for input-tax credit and expense proof; consumer credit-card slips are widely accepted for expense reimbursement.

### Credit-Card Approval & Receipts (Korea)

* **Approval flow:** At purchase, the acquirer issues an **approval/authorization number** (승인번호). Merchant receipts display date/time, amount, and approval number; card PAN is masked except for limited digits.
* **Use as proof:** For personal finance and many corporate policies, the merchant slip plus the approval number suffices as evidence of payment; businesses seeking VAT deduction must rely on tax invoices/cash receipts tied to a business registration.
* **Identifiers:** Receipts may show **receipt/document numbers**, **store codes**, and **barcodes/QR codes** linking to e-receipts or promotions.

### Department-Store Promotions & Gift Sets

* **Gift-set context:** Department stores in Korea heavily market **food and lifestyle gift sets** around major holidays (e.g., Lunar New Year, Chuseok).
* **Pricing & bundles:** Sets are sold at rounded prices (e.g., ₩30,000/₩40,000/₩50,000). They commonly include premium or curated items; VAT applies per set.
* **Promotions:** Event halls often run **brand collaborations/flash sales** (e.g., limited-day discounts). Exclusions (fresh foods, certain categories) are typical.

### Fast-Fashion “UT” (UNIQLO)

* **Definition:** “UT” is UNIQLO’s **graphic T-shirt** line featuring collaborations with art, pop culture, and brands.
* **Typical price band (KRW):** Common list prices range roughly from **₩14,900 to ₩29,900**, with seasonal promotions.
* **Receipt notation:** Items are often marked with a trailing **“T”** to indicate taxable goods; product codes appear as long numerics.

### QR Codes, Digital Vouchers, and “Gifticon”

* **QR on receipts:** Used for e-receipt retrieval, loyalty enrollment, surveys, or promotional redemptions.
* **Gifticon:** A widely used Korean **mobile gift voucher** format delivered via SMS/app; redemption usually requires scanning a QR/barcode within a validity period.

### Receipts as Accounting Evidence (Korea)

* **Personal vs. business use:** For individuals, credit-card slips substantiate spending. For business accounting and VAT credits, **tax invoices or registered cash receipts** are required, matching the business ID.
* **Rounding:** VAT is computed to whole KRW; small rounding differences can occur but should reconcile to the printed total.

## 5. Glossary

* **Taxable Supply (공급가액):** The net amount before VAT to which the VAT rate applies.
* **VAT (부가가치세):** Value-added tax; in Korea, generally 10%.
* **Approval/Authorization No. (승인번호):** Unique number issued by the acquirer confirming a card transaction.
* **Receipt/Document No.:** Merchant-side identifier for the printed receipt instance.
* **Cash Receipt (현금영수증):** Official record of cash payment for tax purposes in Korea.
* **Tax Invoice (세금계산서):** Document enabling VAT input-tax deduction for registered businesses.
* **Gift Set:** Bundled goods sold as a single SKU, common for holiday gifting.

* **QR Code:** Matrix barcode used to link to digital content (e-receipts, apps, promotions).
* **UT:** UNIQLO’s graphic T-shirt product line.

## 6. Assumptions & Limitations

* Images were used as primary evidence; any illegible fields are marked **[UNCLEAR]**.
* Card numbers are intentionally masked; only non-sensitive identifiers are shown.
* Store addresses/contact details were not fully legible; therefore omitted or marked [UNCLEAR].
* Currency is KRW as printed; no FX conversion applied.
* Calculations mirror printed figures; VAT consistency was checked using the 10% standard rate with KRW rounding.

| Item (as printed)         | Unit Price (KRW) | Qty | Line Total (KRW) |
| ------------------------- | ---------------: | --: | ---------------: |
| Coca-Cola 250-ml can      |            1,200 |  30 |           36,000 |
| Crown “Chamssal Seon-gwa” |            5,600 |   1 |            5,600 |
| Haitai “Oh Yes Original”  |            6,800 |   1 |            6,800 |

| **Total of items**        |                  |     |       **60,400** |

### Subtotals / Tax / Total / Amount Paid

| Description          |        KRW |
| -------------------- | ---------: |
| Taxable supply value |     54,909 |
| VAT (10%)            |      5,491 |
| **Grand total**      | **60,400** |
| Amount paid (card)   |     60,400 |

**Notes:** The taxable supply value equals the VAT-inclusive total divided by 1.1 and rounded to the nearest won (60,400 ÷ 1.1 ≈ 54,909.09 → 54,909; VAT 5,491).

## 3. Policy & Terms

* Statement on bag fee: a shopping-bag charge of KRW 30 is included in the purchased goods amount.
* Courtesy message: general “thank you” note shown.
* No explicit return/exchange policy text was visible on the receipt image.

## 4. Major Concepts (Latent Knowledge)

### Value-Added Tax (Korea)

* **Definition & rate:** Korea applies a standard VAT rate of 10% on most goods and services. Some categories are zero-rated (e.g., exports) or exempt (e.g., certain unprocessed foods, medical/educational services).
* **Calculation:** Retail receipts often display (i) taxable supply value and (ii) VAT, where **Total = Supply Value + VAT**. For VAT-inclusive pricing, the supply value is **Total ÷ 1.1**, with VAT as the difference. Rounding is typically to the nearest won.
* **Typical composition:** Most processed foods and beverages are taxable; many unprocessed staple foods can be exempt.

### Credit-Card Sales Slip (Approval Receipt)

* **Purpose:** Serves as proof of payment capturing merchant name, BRN, date/time, amount, approval/authorization number, and masked card details.
* **Expense recognition vs. VAT deduction (KR practice):** For corporate/income tax, a card sales slip issued to a business card generally qualifies as recognized evidence of expense. For **VAT input tax deduction**, a **tax invoice** is ordinarily required; a card slip alone does not usually substitute for a tax invoice except in limited cases defined by law.
* **Cancellation/refund norm:** Card refunds are processed as a **card cancellation** (reversal) to the same card, rather than cash.

### Business Registration Number (BRN) in Korea

* **Format:** 10 digits (XXX-XX-XXXXX). Used to identify the merchant for taxation and verification.
* **Usage:** Appears on receipts/invoices and is used in e-filing, withholding, and cross-checking merchant legitimacy.

### POS/BILL/Approval Identifiers

* **POS no.:** Identifies the specific point-of-sale terminal.
* **Bill/receipt no.:** Merchant’s internal receipt sequence for audit trail.
* **Approval/authorization no.:** Card-network/processor reference confirming transaction authorization; used to trace reversals and disputes.

### Bag/Packaging Fee (Korea)

* **Background:** Under resource-recycling and waste-reduction rules, many retailers charge for disposable shopping bags.
* **Amounts & presentation:** Commonly KRW 50–300 per bag depending on size and local policy. Some merchants itemize it; others include it in the total with a note, as in this receipt.

### Grocery/Retail Item Taxability

* **Processed snacks & beverages:** Generally taxable at 10% (e.g., soft drinks, packaged confectionery).
* **Exempt items:** Certain unprocessed foods (e.g., raw rice, some fresh produce) may be VAT-exempt; when sold together with taxable items, receipts often split taxable vs. exempt subtotals.

### Rounding & Display Practices

* **Rounding:** VAT computations are typically rounded to the nearest won. Small differences can occur due to item-level vs. receipt-level rounding.
* **Display:** Korean receipts commonly show “taxable supply value” and “VAT” rather than “subtotal before tax.”

### Brands/Products (contextual)

* **Coca-Cola:** Global soft-drink brand; small cans often retail around KRW ~1,000–1,500 per can in Korean supermarkets.
* **Crown / Haitai / Lotte (confectionery):** Major Korean snack manufacturers; multi-pack products frequently price in the KRW ~5,000–12,000 range depending on size and promotions.

## 5. Glossary

* **VAT (Value-Added Tax):** A consumption tax levied on the value added at each stage of supply; standard rate in Korea is 10%.
* **Taxable supply value:** The net amount before VAT; for VAT-inclusive totals, calculated as total ÷ 1.1.
* **Approval/authorization number:** Reference issued by the card network/processor to confirm transaction authorization.
* **POS (Point of Sale):** The terminal/system where the transaction is recorded and processed.
* **BRN (Business Registration Number):** Government-issued identifier for businesses in Korea.
* **Lump-sum (one-time) payment:** Full payment at purchase time, not in installments.
* **Electronic approval slip (e-receipt):** Digital/card-network verified sales slip, often labeled “electronic slip.”

## 6. Assumptions & Limitations

* Item names were normalized to English romanization from the printed Korean; exact product variants beyond what is visible were not inferred.
* Card last four digits were not fully legible on the image and are shown as “[UNCLEAR]”.
* All figures, identifiers, and dates reflect what is legible on the provided image; no external data sources were used.
* Currency kept as KRW; no conversions performed.
