Great—here’s your consolidated English version **with additional “latent knowledge” context** (i.e., generally applicable background about how apartment maintenance billing works in Korea). I’ve kept your apartment-specific facts intact and then added expert context where it helps interpret the numbers.

# Added Expert Context (general knowledge in Korea)

### 1) How costs are typically allocated

* **Common vs. exclusive items:**

  * *Common* (security, cleaning, elevator, common electricity/water) are apportioned by an approved rule—**most commonly by exclusive floor area (㎡)** or by a blended formula set in the complex’s management regulations.
  * *Exclusive (unit) usage* (your electricity/water/hot water/gas) is charged by **actual meter readings** and applicable tariffs.
* **Pro-rata credits (“miscellaneous income”):**

  * Revenue from shared assets (e.g., base-station rooftop rent, machine room leases, recyclables) is typically pooled and **credited back** to households using the same pro-rata method as common costs (often by floor area). That’s the small “negative” line on your bill.

### 2) What’s inside the big common buckets

* **Security:** mainly guard wages, with add-ons like uniforms, holidays/night differentials, and guard-room utilities. Outsourced under a service contract.
* **Cleaning:** multi-year contracts with scope by building count/area; sometimes includes periodic deep-cleans (garage pressure-wash, window washing).
* **Elevator:** a fixed **monthly maintenance fee per car**, plus **emergency phone line lease**, and **periodic safety inspections**. Any **major replacements** (e.g., traction machine, controller, door operator) are **capital** and funded from the long-term reserve or a special levy if the reserve is short.
* **Disinfection / sanitation:** scheduled pest control; building-wide disinfection (more frequent in summer); septic-tank service where applicable.

### 3) Tariffs and metering (what to expect)

* **Electricity:**

  * *Unit electricity* follows the residential tariff; **common electricity** covers corridor/parking/yard lights, pumps, elevators, CCTV, etc. Separate meters exist for these categories.
  * Billing windows (e.g., **Jul 18–Aug 18**) won’t always match the calendar month of the management bill; statements align them operationally.
* **Water / Sewer:**

  * Water is billed in **tons (㎥)** with block tariffs by the local utility; the sewer fee is calculated from the water volume according to municipal rules.
* **Hot water / Heating:**

  * Central systems apportion costs by **heat meter (GJ)** or by **hot-water meter (㎥)** and published unit rates; off-season heating is typically zero.

### 4) Long-Term Repair Reserve (how it’s governed in practice)

* **Purpose:** planned renewals (e.g., elevators, roofing, waterproofing, facade sealant, fire pump, heating mains).
* **Funding:** fixed **monthly contributions** per unit (commonly based on exclusive area).
* **Use of funds:** projects follow a **plan and lifecycle** (e.g., elevator ~15–20 yrs; roof membranes ~10–15 yrs, depending on spec).
* **Approvals & disclosure:** spending usually requires **resident or committee approval** per the complex’s management regulations, with **post-disclosure** of bids, contracts, and outcomes.
* **If reserve is insufficient:** a **temporary special assessment** may be levied (separate from monthly fees).

### 5) Governance & transparency you can expect as a resident

* **Annual budgets & closing:** management offices prepare a **yearly budget** and later publish **settlement statements**; deviations vs. budget are explained.
* **Vendor selection:** major service contracts (security/cleaning/elevator) are **tendered** under the complex’s procurement rules; basic contract info (term, fee, vendor) is shared with residents.
* **Dispute/queries:** residents can request **supporting documents** (invoices, meter photos/summaries) for reasonableness checks within a prescribed window; corrections are reflected in the next cycle.
* **Delinquency handling:** late fees and escalation steps are laid out in the management rules (notice → restriction of certain amenities where lawful → legal collection).

### 6) Seasonal & practical considerations

* **Summer spikes:** common electricity (elevators, lobby A/C, pumps) and **disinfection** often peak in summer months.
* **Winter spikes:** heating/hot water shoot up if centrally supplied.
* **Elevator/roof timing:** many complexes **front-load reserve** contributions before large cyclical projects; you might see **stable monthly contributions** but **lumpy capital outflows** in specific months when works execute.

### 7) Quick self-audit tips (resident level)

* Compare **unit electricity/water** against your **last 3–6 months** to spot anomalies.
* Check the **per-car elevator maintenance fee** × number of cars (plus emergency lines & inspections) against what’s disclosed.
* Look at **common kWh per household** trend month-over-month (seasonally). Unexplained jumps can signal lighting schedules, pump issues, or meter timing.
* Confirm **long-term reserve contribution** matches what’s approved for your unit class (by exclusive area).
* Keep an eye on **misc. income credits**—small but steady; sudden changes should have an explanation (e.g., contract renewal of rooftop lease).

* Estate-wide totals indicate normal seasonal patterns (notably common electricity and disinfection in summer).
* Use the checklists above if you want to verify reasonableness or ask the office for a detail sheet (they can provide meter summaries and vendor invoices).
