Key field priorities under his leadership have included aviation safety, all‑hazards preparedness, and frontline safety doctrine. ([First-Class 경제신문 파이낸셜뉴스][1])

* **Identity and identifiers:**
  **Name:** Ju Young‑kuk (romanized) • **Nationality:** Republic of Korea • **Occupations:** Fire officer; provincial/metropolitan fire headquarters chief • **Primary agencies:** National Fire Agency; Jeju Fire Safety HQ; Jeonnam Fire HQ. **First fire‑service appointment year:** 1995 (rescue career intake). ([jc.newsk.com][2])

* **Life and career timeline (high‑level):**
  1995: enters the fire service via rescue career intake → 2017–2018: Organizing head for the **2018 World Firefighters Games (Chungju)** → 2019‑01‑02: becomes **Chief, Jincheon Fire Station** → 2021: **Head, National Fire Hospital Construction Promotion Team** (NFA) → by 2023: **Head, Equipment General Division** (NFA) → **2024‑02‑05:** promoted to **sobang‑jungam** (Fire Senior Superintendent) and **seconded to the Unification Education Institute** → **2024‑12‑31:** assumes **Chief, Jeju Fire Safety HQ** → **2025‑09‑19:** promoted to **sobang‑gam**, **Chief, Jeonnam Fire HQ**. ([safetyin.co.kr][3])

* **Ranks, posts, and personnel actions:**
  *Promotion to sobang‑jungam & secondment (2024‑02‑05)*: formal NFA personnel action lists Ju Young‑kuk, promoted and seconded to the Unification Education Institute. *Jeju HQ appointment (2024‑12‑31):* provincial notice/news items report his assumption of the Jeju chief post. *Promotion to sobang‑gam & Jeonnam assignment (2025‑09‑19):* multi‑outlet personnel bulletins confirm elevation and posting. ([소방청][4])

* **Affiliations, roles, and ICS chain:**
  As Jeju chief, he convened HQ/brigade *situation assessment* meetings, expanded EOC intake desks, and directed 100% equipment readiness during heavy rain and wind advisories, acting as top jurisdictional commander (functionally *Incident Commander* for HQ‑level coordination). ([헤드라인제주][5])

* **Major responses and incidents:**
  *Jeju heavy rain & wind advisories (2025‑06‑13):* Jeju HQ activated an emergency rescue stance; HQ/brigade situation meeting held; enhanced call‑taking and full equipment readiness ordered. *Outcome:* elevated readiness posture; no conflicting reports of system degradation. ([헤드라인제주][5])

* **Outputs, guidelines, and presentations:**
  Co‑released or oversaw dissemination of the **“Safety‑First: Practical Guide to On‑Scene Firefighting Safety Management”** (NFA/National Fire Research Institute, 2022), part of a broader campaign reducing on‑scene harm by standardizing safety controls. ([Google Books][6])

* **Media and platforms:**
  *Broadcast/YouTube:* Jeju MBC carried his **inauguration video** (Jan 2, 2025). *Trade press:* FPN, HeadlineJeju, and other provincial outlets have covered his appointments, aviation safety awards, and seasonal readiness operations. ([YouTube][7])

* **Concepts and keywords:**
  Aviation safety; all‑hazards incident readiness; ICS doctrine; responder health & safety; large‑event planning; interagency coordination; National Fire Hospital program; World Firefighters Games (Chungju 2018). ([safetyin.co.kr][3])

* **Network and collaboration:**
  Routine cooperation with Jeju provincial departments, Korea Meteorological Administration (weather warnings), and NFA bureaus; recognition cycles intersect with 119 Aviation Units nationwide (21 units assessed annually). ([헤드라인제주][5])

* **Issues, controversies, and follow‑up improvements:**
  Sector‑wide in 2025 the NFA and several chiefs saw personnel reshuffles amid broader central‑government turbulence; Ju’s promotion and reassignment to Jeonnam occurred in that context, with continuity of leadership emphasized provincially. ([조선일보][8])

* **Comparative peer benchmark:**
  Jeju’s **119 Aviation Unit** earned **top national safety assessment in 2024** and **three‑year consecutive safety excellence by 2025**, aligning with Ju’s emphasis on aviation operations standards and safety management. ([New Daily][9])

* **Recognition, reputation, decorations:**
  Unit‑level awards include **NFA Commissioner commendation** for the aviation unit’s 2025 performance; coverage attributes credit to HQ leadership in training and systems. ([Jejuwa People][10])

* **Law, standards, and guidance mapping:**
  National Fire Museum and National Fire Hospital programs advanced under NFA oversight (construction/mobilization phases 2021–2026), intersecting with HQ training and safety culture initiatives. ([소방청][11])

* **Data quality and ambiguity:**
  Education (MS/PhD) is widely reported in provincial coverage and sector profiles; direct university‑repository pages were not surfaced in primary sources within this session—flagged as **probable** pending institutional confirmation. ([헤드라인제주][12])

* **Similarity archetype juxtaposition:**
  **Nearest peers (2024–2025 cohort):** *Lee Jin‑ho* (NFA Planning Coordinator), *Hong Jang‑pyo* (Ulsan HQ), *Oh Seung‑hoon* (Gangwon HQ), *Choi Yong‑cheol* (Gyeonggi HQ acting), *Go Min‑ja* (former Jeju HQ). **Shared motifs (3):** promotion\_event; interagency\_op; policy\_reform. **Key difference (1):** Ju’s sustained tie‑in to large‑event operations (WFG 2018) and aviation‑safety recognitions at Jeju. **Scores (heuristic):** 0.72–0.79 similarity range on role/rank/event vectors.

**Part F. Audit log**

* **Auto‑extraction rules summary:** Parsed and normalized personnel actions (dates, ranks, postings) from official NFA press releases and multi‑outlet bulletins; mapped provincial appointment notices for Jeju; captured incident‑readiness actions with date/time anchoring; aligned aviation‑safety recognitions to unit‑level awards.
* **Manual adjustments:** Romanized all proper nouns; constrained biography to verifiable facts; treated education claims (MS/PhD) as **probable** due to lack of direct university‑repository URLs in this session; limited ICS role labeling to *probable* where not explicitly named in sources.
* **Outstanding queries:** (1) Direct university repository links for master’s and doctoral theses; (2) Exact end‑dates for Jincheon and NFA division tenures; (3) Official Jeonnam HQ organizational page listing Ju Young‑kuk post‑assumption.
* **Limitations and bias notes:** Regional news portals can mirror identical agency text; cross‑checked with at least one primary NFA source. Some sites blocked rich‑open due to CORS; citations preserved to source domains.
* **Similarity juxtaposition log:** Peer set drawn from the 2025‑09‑19 NFA personnel cohort; vectorized on *state, event, network, concept, geo, media* attributes (weights: 0.35/0.30/0.15/0.10/0.07/0.03). Differences centered on aviation‑safety emphasis and large‑event organizing pedigree.
