## Part F. Audit log

- **Extraction & normalization:** Harmonized romanization; mapped ranks to dictionary tokens; standardized agency names with parenthetical Korean for key proper nouns; enforced ISO dates (Unknown where day/month not available).  
- **Source integration:** Prioritized official/primary (KNPA; KLRI). Added reputable secondary (Asiae EN, MBC, Newspim, KGNews) and corroborative items (Financial News; Daum relay; KJD).  
- **HR reconciliation:** Promotion (2024‑08‑10) and GNPA inauguration (2024‑08‑16) aligned; Gangwon inauguration (2023‑10‑30) aligned.  
- **Operations linkage:** Added Dec 3–4 NEC perimeter posture under review; logged witness then suspect summons with dates and status.  
- **Ambiguities & rebuttals:** Exact entry day in 1993 Unknown; official promotion press PDF not surfaced in session; precise unit command dates approximated (plausible) from corpus—flagged as such.  
- **Metrics gaps (to fill):** Cost‑performance curves for equipment programs; before/after metrics on reporting‑chain simplification; formal AAR excerpts mapping command → transmission → action to training updates.  
- **Similarity archetype method:** Weights {state:0.30, event:0.30, network:0.15, concept:0.10, geo:0.10, media:0.05}; peer selected (Lee Young‑pal) due to scale of safety leadership and interagency motifs.  
- **Compliance checks:** One code fence; English‑only with permitted parentheticals; valid GFM tables; TSV and JSON‑LD wrapped in tildes; ≥5 credible sources; at least one primary source included; no personal sensitive data.
